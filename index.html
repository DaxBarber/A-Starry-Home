<p style="color:white;font-family:monospace;text-align:center;font-size:400%;">While Mars is probably the best choice we have right now due to it's distance from us, temperature, and water for us to extract as well as a variety of other reasons, let's go over each of the planets and the pros and cons of colonizing them.<br><br>Mercury - Very difficult if not impossible to colonize<br>Pros: There's ice at the poles which we could mine for water and oxygen<br>Cons: The temperatures are extremly variable ranging from 800 degrees Farenheit in the daytime to minus 290 degrees Farenheit at nighttime<br><br>Venus - Would be extremly difficult to colonize<br>Pros: size and gravity very similar to Earth<br>Cons: Has a runaway greenhouse effect and mumerous volcanoes on the surface<br><br>Mars - Probably the best planet to colonize but still harsh<br>Pros: Close to us and temperatures relatively close to Earth's<br>Cons: Large dust storms due to to temperature fluctiations as well as intense radiation from space<br><br>Jupiter - Is a gas giant so I'm gonna be focusing on one of Jupiter's moons, Europa<br>Pros: has low radiation levels, geologic stability and large amounts of water ice.<br>Cons: Has no atmosphere and has an average temperature of minus 260 degrees Farenheit<br><br>Saturn - Is also a gas giant so I'll be using Titan, one of Saturn'm moons<br>Pros: You wouldn't need a pressurized suit to survive<br>Cons: Can get as cold as -290 degrees Fahrenheit<br><br>Uranus - An ice giant so I'm gonna talk about Titania, one of Uranus' moons<br>Pros: There is no weather<br>Cons: It has no atmosphere<br><br>Neptune - Is also an ice giant so I'll be focusing on Neptune's moon Triton<br>Pros: Has low garvity so movement is easy<br>Cons: Has an average temperature of minus 391 degrees Farenheit</p>
