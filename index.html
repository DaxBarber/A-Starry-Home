  <p style="color:white;font-family:monospace;text-align:left;font-size:200%;"><img style="float:right;" src="https://cdn.britannica.com/06/72006-050-5EF22ECB/Michael-Lopez-Alegria-space-module-station-assembly-International-October-2000.jpg" alt="Astronaut In Space" width="18%" height="27%">Humans are an expansive species. This means that we are always looking for new places to
     explore and well, expand towards. It first started when life began to come out of the ocean and slowly but surely explored land. Around 650 million years later, almost all land on Earth has been explored. That leaves us with two places to expand to. The ocean and space. The ocean has had it's fair share of exploration, but at the deppest points, manned missions can be just as dangerous and deadly as space missions. Space has an infinite amount of room and in my opinion is way more worth the time and money than exploring the ocean.</p>
     <h1 style="color:white;text-align:center;font-family:monospace;font-size:300%;">Why should we explore space?</h1>
    <p style="color:white;font-family:monospace;text-align:right;font-size:175%;"><img style="float:left;" src="https://www.marssociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/elon-musk-mars-city-cost-10-trillion-1200x630-1.jpg" alt="Mars Colony"  width="54%" height="62%">There are numerous reasons why exploring space would be beneficial to humanity. The first, and in my opinion one of the most obvious, is colonization. Space exploration is the only way that humans could escape the death of the sun. The second is space mining. If we could find a way to mine asteroids we could basically have a somewhat infinite amount of raw materials at our disposal which would make technology significantly cheaper. The final, and in my opinion, the most important reason is that humans are explorers. Are curiosity is what formed civilizations and allowed humans to survive for so long. Exploring the universe around us is the logical next step.</p>
