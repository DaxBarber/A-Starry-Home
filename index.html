This means that we are always looking for new places to
     explore and well, expand towards. It first started when life began to come out of the ocean and slowly but surely explored land. Around 650 million years later, almost all land on Earth has been explored. That levaes us with two places to expand to. The ocean and space. The ocean has had it's fair share of exploration, but at the deppest points, manned missions can be just as dangerous and deadly as space missions. Space has an infinite amount of room and in my opinion is way more worth the time and money than exploring the ocean.</p>
