This means that we are always looking for new places to
     explore and well, expand towards. It first started when life began to go out of the ocean and slowly and surely explored land. Fast forward around 4 billion years and almost all land on Earth has been explored. That levaes us with two places to expand. The ocean and space. While the ocean has had it's fair share of exploration, but it's living conditions are very harsh, especially at the deep points. Space has infinitely more space than the ocean and is the only way that humaninty would be able to escape Earth if things were to turn south.</p>
